# Task
The task is to make the UI built with the CSS challenge dynamic and interactive. General notes:
- Application can be built with any tools/libraries (if needed)
- Application should use an API architecture, where dummy data can be returned from the APIs directly within
the code, no real server-side code is required
- The data can be stored in localStorage or state management systems
- At the start up of the application, some cards should be already available
  
**Interactions**:

- **Add new card**
  - Open a modal where the user can add the card name and submit it. The expiration date and
    card number will be randomly generated by the system.
  - The card will be appended in the carousel together with the other cards

- **Freeze/Unfreeze card**
  - On click of the freeze card, the card will get the frozen status
  - The frozen card will look different from the others (up to the candidate for the look of it can
    be a simple semi-transparent opacity value applied)
  - The freeze button will toggle to “unfreeze” for the frozen card


# Running the App

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

#Install Node[>22.0] from official website for your development device.

## Step 1: Start Metro
On your terminal go to a folder where you would like to test this project. Execute the following command to initialize a blank repo.

## Step 2: Cloning the repo
Then clone this repository in your initialized repo.
```sh
git init
git clone https://github.com/vishalsinghsaini/AspireHomeAssignment.git
```
Now run the following commands to set up Node Modules required for the project.

## Step 2: Installing the packages
```sh
npm install / yarn install / yarn
```

## Step 3: Install pod dependencies
```sh
yarn pod / cd ios && pod install

```
Now, to test on emulator make sure your environment variables are set up as per recommendations here for -- iOS(https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) -- Android(https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
To test on physical devices, follow the guide as shared here
You can generate Android Project folder and iOS xcodeproject by following the instructions here for iOS and here for Android

## Step 4: Start the app on android by running below command
```sh
yarn android
```

## Step 5: Start the app on IOS by running below command
```sh
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
